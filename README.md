# React Flicker API App
In this project, I needed to leverage everything we have learned about React Components Routing, State, and Props. Alongside the project, I havd to pull the photos from the flicker api using a config.js file to hold my unique api key with axios as the main driver for fetching the data.

This project is initialized with create-react-app. I wanted to learn how to use the latest edition to React, React Hooks, so you will find calls to UseState and UseEffect in this project.

## App Configuration Requirements
Users will need to provide their own api key credentials in their own instances of the application. You can grab a NON-COMMERCIAL API key for free at https://www.flickr.com/services/apps/create/apply

- Create a config.js file in the /src folder to hold their own API credentials

```javaScript
  const apiKey = "YOUR OWN API KEY"
  export default apiKey;
```

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
